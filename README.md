## Project Overview

## Dataset

The dataset contains **8,599 customer** reviews for **12 restaurants** located in the **Streatham area**. The reviews were extracted from Google Maps using the web scraping tool **Apify**. The dataset is comprehensive, featuring **93 columns** that provide a wide range of information, from metadata to sentiment-related details. Below is a unified overview of the most relevant columns used in this project, categorized into restaurant tags, location/context metadata, structured review feedback, and sentiment-related fields.

| `postalCode`                                   | Postal code of the restaurant's physical location. Useful for regional sentiment trends and geographic clustering.                             |

| `reviewDetailedRating/Service`                 | Numeric score for service experience (e.g., staff friendliness, professionalism). Complements `reviewContext/Service` for stronger analysis.   |
|                                                |                                                                                                                                                 |
| **üí¨ Sentiment Input Fields**                   |                                                                                                                                                 |
| `text`                                         | The full body of the written review. Main source for sentiment classification and aspect-based opinion mining.                                 |
| `name`                                         | The **reviewer's name** or username. Useful for tracking repeat reviewers or studying reviewer credibility and bias patterns.                  |
| `stars`                                        | Star rating given by the reviewer (usually 1 to 5). Often used as a weak label for supervised sentiment model training.                        |
| `totalScore`                                   | The overall average Google rating for the restaurant. Useful as a benchmark to compare individual review sentiment with business reputation.    |

There are **3,010** null values in the `text` column out of a total of **8,599** reviews, meaning that approximately **35%** of the reviews lack textual content. However, all 3,010 entries with a null text column do have a star rating. Including a sentiment proxy mapping for the reviews with null text entries (based on their star ratings) will provide a complete sentiment analysis across all 8,599 reviews. The process of sentiment proxy mapping will be discussed in the Experiments section.
